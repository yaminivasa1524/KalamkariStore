Initial representation of Kalamkari art was as religious paintings that depicted Indian Gods. Kalamkari started off during the

 Mughal dynasty and presently Andhra Pradesh is the largest producer of Kalamkari fabric. Kalamkari is an intricate art form and req
 uires a tedious technique in its making; because of which the art of Kalamkari was losing its shine. With the emergence of high qual
 ity machine looms and acceptance for printed textiles; Kalamkari art came on the verge of extinction. However, printed Kalamkari is a 
 new craze among the current generation, as it is a combination of traditional and modern trends. Fashion industry came together to revi
 ve this art and helped artisans of Andhra Pradesh for practicing this art. Kalamkari sarees, kalamkari dresses and kalamkari blouses are
 a huge running trend. Several fashion designers beautifully portrayed kalamkari sarees on fashion runways and got a great response.
